# Image-DB
## Overview
Image-DB is a project aimed at creating an easily deployable database to efficiently find images stored on your local computer or online through public URLs. With Image-DB, you can tag images with multiple tags and easily look them up based on those tags, making it simpler to manage and retrieve images without remembering file names.

This project was born out of a personal need to manage a vast collection of art reference images. Instead of manually searching through folders, Image-DB allows you to store and search for images by tags, making it a powerful tool for artists, photographers, and anyone who needs to manage large collections of images.
